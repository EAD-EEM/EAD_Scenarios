# EAD_Scenarios
Data files used for water modelling by PRMA/EAD

## Weather 
All weather data comes from [Environment Canada](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html). These files cover the years 1969 through 2018. They are each based on data from one city, but with missing values taken from nearby locations, or by interpolation.

## GWScenarios
There are seven standard scenarios used by EAD for groundwater modelling. Scenarios from Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta are not included because PRZM produces insufficient water leaching.

## Use
Unzip the zipped directory containing the weather files. Use the "Use Weather Directory" input in PWC 2.0 to set the locations of the weather files. Alternatively, the weather file location can be edited in each scenario.
